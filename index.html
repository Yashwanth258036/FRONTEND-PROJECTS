        Java's history began in 1991 at Sun Microsystems as the "Green Project," initially for consumer electronics, with the first language named "Oak" by James Gosling. The project shifted to focus on the World Wide Web in 1993, and in 1995, "Oak" was renamed "Java" due to trademark issues and publicly launched with the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy. Key milestones include the public release of Java 1.0 in 1995, Netscape Navigator's integration of Java, and the significant advancements in Java 1.1, which added features like JavaBeans and JDBC.
