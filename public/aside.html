    Java Tutorial
Last Updated : 01 Nov, 2025
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to build web apps, mobile applications, and enterprise software systems.

Known for its Write Once, Run Anywhere capability, which means code written in Java can run on any device that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Syntax and structure is similar to C-based languages like C++ and C#.

Basic Code Example
The following is a simple program that displays the message “Hello, World!” on the screen.




public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
To understand working of this code, refer Java Introduction.

Why Learn Java?
Used to build Android apps, desktop and web apps, enterprise backend systems, and cloud-based software.
In high demand with many job opportunities in software development.
Has popular frameworks like Spring and Hibernate which makes it powerful for enterprise applications.
Supports object-oriented programming for clean, maintainable and reusable code.
Top companies like Amazon, Netflix, and LinkedIn use Java.
Basics
Java basics form the foundation of your programming journey, covering essential concepts like syntax, data types, variables, loops, and conditionals.

Methods
Java methods are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks and help organize your program. They improve code readability, reduce repetition, and make debugging easier.

Introduction to Methods
Static Methods vs Instance Methods
Access Modifiers
Command Line Arguments
Variable Arguments (Varargs)
Quiz: Methods
Arrays
Java arrays are containers that store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable. They provide an efficient way to manage and access collections of data using index-based positions.

OOP Concepts
Java follows the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, which organizes code into classes and objects. Core OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction make Java modular and scalable.

What are OOP Concepts?
Classes and Objects
Quiz: Classes and Objects
Constructors
Quiz: Constructors
Object Class
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Quiz: Inheritance and Abstraction
Polymorphism
Packages

Interfaces
Java interfaces define a contract that classes must follow, specifying method signatures without implementations. They enable abstraction and support multiple inheritance in Java through a clean, structured approach.

Interfaces
Class vs Interface
Quiz: Interfaces
Functional Interface
Nested Interface
Marker Interface
Quiz: Interface types and Comparator
Project: Employee Management System
Exception Handling
Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the program runs smoothly without crashing. It uses keywords like try, catch, throw, throws, and finally to manage exceptions.
Memory Allocation
Java Memory Allocation refers to how memory is assigned to variables, objects, and classes during program execution. It involves stack and heap memory, with the JVM managing allocation and garbage collection automatically.
